# Project: Queue-Processing-Simulation



Implemented a process simulation system as part of a side project. The project, developed in C++, involved creating a simulation environment to manage and process various events related to CPU and I/O bursts for multiple processes.

#### Key Contributions:

**Event Handling:** Designed a comprehensive event-handling mechanism to manage arrivals, CPU and I/O bursts, exits, and timeouts.<br>
**Priority Queue:** Implemented a priority queue to organize events, ensuring timely processing based on priority criteria.<br>
**Process Management:** Created a Process class to represent individual processes, managing their arrival times, CPU and I/O bursts, exit times, and wait times. <br>
**Queue Implementation:** Developed a flexible queue structure to efficiently organize and dequeue processes awaiting CPU and I/O operations.<br>
**Simulation Control:** Programmed the Simulation class to control the simulation flow, including scheduling events, managing process queues, and tracking simulation time.<br>
**IO and CPU Burst Handling:** Implemented StartIO and StartCpu events to initiate I/O and CPU bursts, respectively, and scheduled corresponding CompleteIO and CompleteCpu events based on burst completion or timeout.<br>
**Technologies and Tools:**
C++, Object-Oriented Programming, Simulation, Priority Queue, Queue Implementation.<br>

#### Outcome:
Successfully executed simulations, tracked process behavior, and generated a final summary detailing arrival times, exit times, and wait times for all processes. The project demonstrated proficiency in event-driven simulation and system-level design.

#### Remark:
The implementation showcased strong problem-solving skills and a solid understanding of data structures and simulation techniques. The project contributed to the development of a robust and efficient simulation engine capable of handling various process scenarios.
